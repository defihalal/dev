                <br />
                <br />A Trove is where you take out and maintain your loan. Each Trove is linked to a
                Polygon address and each address can have just one Trove. If you are familiar with
                Vaults or CDPs from other platforms, Troves are similar in concept. <br />
                <br />
                Troves maintain two balances: one is an asset (MATIC) acting as collateral and the
                other is a debt denominated in USDH. You can change the amount of each by adding
                collateral or repaying debt. As you make these balance changes, your Troveâ€™s
                collateral ratio changes accordingly. <br />
                <br />
                You can close your Trove at any time by fully paying off your debt.
